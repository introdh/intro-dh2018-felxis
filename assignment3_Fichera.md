## Process for creating the data

To create this StoryMap, I first had to begin with collecting data. To collect data, I self-documented my location at every hour for an entire week. I compiled the data into a spreadsheet, followed by adding latitude and longitude coordinates for each location, using Google Maps as a reference for the coordinates. After the data was collected, I loading them into the arcgis software and began creating my StoryMap.

I first began the project by imagining I would have a slide for each day of the week, but quickly found it did not tell my story the way I wanted to, because it did not give me as much opportunity to talk about other important activities in my daily life. Instead, I picked the most important spaces I spend time on a weekly basis and chose to incorporate those spaces into my assignment.

The order of the slides on my StoryMap is also important. I decided to start with what I thought were the most important spaces to myself. This included places such as the Business school, Gottwald and the Queally Center. The later slides were not as much places I spend on a regular basis, but rather activities, like visiting family and going out to dinner with friends.
