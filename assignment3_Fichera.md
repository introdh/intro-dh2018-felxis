## Process for creating the data

To create this StoryMap, I first had to begin with collecting data. To collect data, I self-documented my location at every hour for an entire week. I compiled the data into a spreadsheet, followed by adding latitude and longitude coordinates for each location, using Google Maps as a reference for the coordinates. After the data was collected, I loading them into the arcgis software and began creating my StoryMap.

I first began the project by imagining I would have a slide for each day of the week, but quickly found it did not tell my story the way I wanted to, because it did not give me as much opportunity to talk about other important activities in my daily life. Instead, I picked the most important spaces I spend time on a weekly basis and chose to incorporate those spaces into my assignment.

The order of the slides on my StoryMap is also important. I decided to start with what I thought were the most important spaces to myself. This included places such as the Business school, Gottwald and the Queally Center. The later slides were not as much places I spend on a regular basis, but rather activities, like visiting family and going out to dinner with friends.

## Challenges of Representing Space and Place as Applied to Your Map

The challenge facing arcgis as a use to showcase space over place lies in its visual nature. It can be very difficult to use visuals only to express the difference between space and place.

It is essential to also incorporate words and other mediums so the audience can ascertain the distinction between the two. Bodenhamer writes, "All spaces contain embedded stories based on what has happened there. These stories are both individual and collective, and each of them links geography (space) and history (time). More important, they all reflect the values and cultural codes present in the various political and social arrangements that provide structure to society. In this sense, then, the meaning of space, especially as place or landscape, is always being constructed through the various contests that occur over power.” (Bodenhamer. Springer, 2013).

I can pinpoint its location on a map or put as many pictures of the Queally Center or the Business school as I want into my StoryMap, but no matter what I add to each slide, it is nearly impossible to communicate what a specific space means to me. And this same problem can be seen with any single individual’s unique spaces across campus.
