## Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project.
What employers (banks, NGOs, etc.) produce the most board members?

Is there a relationship between preceding employer and political party?

Do certain industries (of predecessor employers) have a closer relationship to US macroeconomic policy than others? (i.e. do more board members come from the healthcare industry)

Board seat terms last 14 years and are appointed by the President. Are there any instances of Boards having a political majority while another party holds the office of presidency?

## Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the project’s principal activities and its expected results.
This project would conduct a network analysis of the board members of the Federal Reserve. The network would depict all seven members’ predecessor and successor employers before and after serving on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, as well as their political affiliation. This would allow is to study

The hope is to gather insights to form a better understanding about who influences US economic policy, what parties create the biggest economic policy change, and how economic policy is created.

A network model is the best digital humanities tool for this project because it will visualize and describe the relationships each board member has had with private and public industry, thus allowing us as researches to draw insights and conclusions about the data.

To provide some more background information, board seats are positions with terms of 14 years in length, with one new member being appointed by the President every two years. There are currently three vacant positions on the board. President Trump has nominated three individuals to fill the positions but each candidate is awaiting confirmation hearings and a senate vote.

This study would take place over the entire lifespan of the US Federal Reserve Bank, as there have only ever been 94 members of the Board of Governors, dating back to 1914 when the position was established. A 95th member, Michelle Bowman, was approved in November 2018 with a starting date TBD.
