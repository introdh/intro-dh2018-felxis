Scope of the Journal
-
The Journal of Finance is the most read and most prestigious publication in the scholarly field of finance. In fact, it is rated as the most cited academic journal in the Business/Finance category. The journal accepts articles from all areas of study within finance. Many articles posted in the Journal of Finance have come to change how we think about finance and how we build better models to evaluate finance. I picked this journal for this assignment because it was an area of study I am very interested in as I will be graduating with a concentration in finance in May.


Questions to Answer
-
The purpose of this topic model is to answer questions about finance itself. Before the analysis, I sat down with the following questions I wanted to answer:
1. What words have been used most since the journals publication?
2. How have economic booms and recessions impacted the topics finance scholars write and research about?
3. Are there any past trends to support what will be written about in the future?
4. What is being written about right now?


Data Selected for Corpus
-
The data selected was the entire publication of the journal of finance, which began publication in 1946. I selected the entire publication because it was necessary to get as much historical data as possible to answer the questions I had set forth at the beginning of the assignment. There were over 9,000 articles analyzed, which is a good sample size for the scope of this assignment. It will also ensure that many niche topics within finance will be covered in the scope of this analysis.


Number of Topics
-
When it came to topic modeling this academic journal, it was appropriate to use 20 topics. The model was first created using 25 topics. However, I felt this number to be too high, as there were many topics with common words overlapping in multiple topics. With so many common words amongst many of the topics, I could not draw any conclusions through analysis.

After I had realized 25 topics was too specific a model, I cut the number of topics to 15, but again ran into problems. This time, the topic model became too broad. With only 15 topics, there were certain topics, such as banking, that did not have their own separate topic.

Finally, I settled on 20 topics. I found 20 topics to be appropriate for this journal because it gave the most diverse set of topics without any overlapping or common words. 20 topics allowed for specific topics such as Abnormal Firms and Markets to be included in this analysis, a topic not relatively discussed too often in finance.


Initial Findings and Arguments
-
The topic with the highest weight is the international finance topic, encompassing 11.9% of the corpus. It does not surprise me that these are the most discussed topics in finance. As technology continues to shock industries and globalization becomes more apparent with each passing day, international finance will become more and more important. Different currencies will become easier to obtain, as will foreign bonds and securities. The data suggests this trend will continue in the future. When the journal first started publication back in 1946, the world was still recovering from the aftermath of the Second World War. Back then, many national economies chose to exclude themselves from the global market. Today, the opposite is true, making international finance a top priority.

Following international finance is banking and undergraduate finance, both with 9.1%. Banking is the bloodline of finance, so like international finance, it does not surprise me to see it have such a heavy weighting in the journal of finance. As the data suggests, thanks to the same technology and globalization themes previously mentioned, banking has been an industry that has dominated finance for decades, and will continue to dominate finance for decades to come.

While I was neither surprised by international finance nor banking, I was extremely surprised to see undergraduate finance to be such a highly discussed topic in the corpus. Some of the notable unique words used in this topic include: university, school and research. This means a large chunk of scholarly finance research is dedicated to universities and other institutions I would have thought I would have found more articles in this topic to be found in the Journal of Financial Education, and not the Journal of Finance.

The final notable topic was risk, which made up 6.7% of the corpus. I expected this topic to have a higher weight than it did. Risk is one of the fundamental concepts of finance. Without risk, there is no financial reward. This topic included many variations of risk, including portfolio risk, exchange rate risk, regulatory risks, and more. This topic is a broader range of words than the market risk topic, which was more specific.

There was no topic that deeply studied individual consumers, but this is to be expected in a finance journal. That type of research would be more suited to an economics journal.
