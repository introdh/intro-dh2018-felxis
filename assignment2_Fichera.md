## Data Corpus
In this analysis, United States Supreme Court cases from different fields of expertise were mapped using network analysis to find underlying correlation between different areas of law. The data itself comes from a project conducted by Washington University in St. Louis, which worked to code every United States Supreme Court case to a specific legal issue, such as education, desegregation, etc.

For this networking assignment I decided to analyze two data sets from the Supreme Court data sets. The two topics I chose were Federal Taxation, typically under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (120010) and State or Local Government Tax (80100) (for ease, there are instances where I refer to State and Local Tax as SALT). My reasoning for choosing these two topics is because both of these topics interested me, and I was interested in, if any, instances in which SALT laws were cited and used to enforce federal tax laws, or vice versa. My hope, was that correlations found through the network map would bring forth new information about how SALT laws will be written or changed in the future due to the massive recent changes in the federal tax code.

The following network maps were made regarding the analysis.

### Plot Co-Citation Issue
I felt conducting this analysis using the co-citations function severly limited the scope of the network, and thus analysis. Out of the dozens of cases coded into these two topic areas, there was only a single federal taxation case that met the co-citation requirements, meaning it was cited in at least nine other cases. With only one federal taxation case correlated to many SALT cases, it is extremely difficult to generalize the relationship for any meaningful analysis.
