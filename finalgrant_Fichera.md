## Narrative

## Enhancing the Humanities

### Project activities

The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States is responsible for designing, creating, and implementing economic policy in the United States. The Federal Reserve has either direct or indirect power to manipulate the economy through different means such as controlling the amount of cash in the economy, regulating interest rates, etc. The Federal Reserve is run by a group of seven members, called the Board of Governors. Each member is appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the US Senate. Board seats are positions with terms of 14 years in length, with one seat’s term expiring every two years. There are currently two vacant positions on the board. President Trump has nominated two individuals to fill the positions but each candidate is awaiting confirmation hearings and a senate vote.

The main goal of the project is to gather insights about the past and post-position tendencies of board members in order to form a better understanding about the daily influences of the people in charge of taking care of the economy, so that there can be a better understanding of how economic policy is created. A list of characteristics will be outlined as potential influences, including characteristics such as race, gender, political affiliation, etc. Expanding the scope of the project even further, 

This project would analyze and depict the data using multiple network maps of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Each network would depict a different descriptive characteristic of each board member.

A network model is the best digital humanities tool for this project because it will visualize and describe the relationships each board member has had with private and public industry, thus allowing us as researches to draw insights and conclusions about the data. As Mark Newman writes, "A network is a simplified representation that reduces a system to an abstract structure capturing only the basics of connection patterns and little else" (Newman, Oxford Scholarship Online, 2016). For example, one of the networks would depict all seven members’ predecessor and successor employers before and after serving on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Another network would map their political affiliation. A more specific description of the network map is provided below in the Work Plan section of this grant proposal.

### Ultimate Project Results

There is incredible value to scholars, students and general audiences if this project is completed. At the end of the day, economic policy effects every person in the country. It is valuable to scholars because it will allow them to predict the future health of the economy. It is important to students because it is a broad economic topic that, with a better understanding, will help when entering the employment pool upon graduation, since the job placement rate is correlated to the health of the economy. Finally, the project will provide value to general audiences because the economy effects each person in the country. It will effect loans, mortgages, and retirement plans. If a more accurate model of the US economy can be created, it will reduce risk in the market, benefitting the general consumer.

This study would take place over the entire lifespan of the US Federal Reserve Bank, as there have only ever been 94 members of the Board of Governors, dating back to 1914 when the position was established. A 95th member, Michelle Bowman, was approved in November 2018 with a starting date TBD.

### Scope of project

To have a successful outcome to the project, there needs to be a set of defined humanities questions that will be addressed and answered. The following is a list of questions that can be answered through the completion of this project. More questions could be added to list as work is performed.

* What is the age/race/gender of the typical board member?
* What employers (banks, NGOs, etc.) produce the most board members?
*	Is there a relationship between preceding employer and political party?
*	Do certain industries produce more board members, meaning they have a closer relationship to US macroeconomic policy than others?
*	Board seat terms last 14 years and are appointed by the President. Are there any instances of Boards having a political majority while another party holds the office of presidency?

A thorough due diligence search was conducted on the database of preexisting geospatial data at data.gov. Despite the exhaustive search, no closely related data set could be found. Additionally, a search of the Federal Reserve Data Download Program was conducted. Like with the search of data.gov, this search also yielded similar results, as the Federal Reserve Data Download Program is used primarily for economic data such as interest rates and consumer credit, not anywhere close in relation to the descriptive data required for this project.

To complete this project, new data will be produced and developed. All data will be created in accordance with all proposed guidance found at www.fgdc.gov as well as Article 34 of the General Terms and Conditions for Awards.

If we can identify the most common descriptive characteristics of the past Federal Reserve Board members, that information can be used to target potential future board members. Once the future

Additionally, with this information, we can conduct a continuing empirical analysis, with help from physiological insights, to correlate the descriptive characteristics that most heavily effect each board member’s decision making to find the few different types of descriptive characteristics that effect US economic policy.


## Environmental Scan

During the environmental scan portion of this proposal, there were two projects found that have similar intentions to this proposed project, but had different results as they were studying different things.
The first example comes from Matthew Jockers, a university professor of digital humanities, in chapter 4 of his book, Macroanalysis, he describes macroanalysis as a way of using a computer program to read things from a distance, or a macro-level. He calls this, “distant reading” (Jockers, University of Illinois Press, 2013).

In his project he uses macroanalysis to conduct text analysis in 19th century literature. His goal is to see how cultural and economic changes have

In his project, he is analyzing descriptive characteristics, such as writing styles, to cross reference against qualitative facts, such as economic metrics. Jockers writes, “A macroanalytic approach helps us not only to see and understand the operations of a larger “literary economy,” but, by means of scale, to better see and understand the degree to which literature and the individual authors who manufacture that literature respond to or react against literary and cultural trends” (Jockers, University of Illinois Press, 2013).

This proposed project has a similar goal but is focused on a different means of coming to its conclusion. In this proposed project, the descriptive characteristics previously mentioned will be used to form a quantitative model that will predict the future of the economy. Jockers found the relationship between literature and the economy, but this project takes that relationship a step further by using the relationship to build a predictive model.

The second example of a similar project is illustrated below:

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh2018-felxis/blob/master/images/board%20of%20directors.png "F500 Board of Directors")

The illustration comes from the Reddit page ‘Data Is Beautiful’ and shows that 80% of Fortune 500 companies share at least one board member. The relationships observed in this illustration involve executive board members who preside over multiple companies, and which companies share board members. For example, according to this study, Apple shares at least one board member with JPMorgan Chase. By seeing how interconnected Fortune 500 companies are, based on board members, it can be observed how similarly two Fortune 500 companies will act both now and in the future.

The chart is a stunning revelation into the inner workings of the most important decision makers impacting private industry in the United States, and even around the world, as most of the companies included in the illustration are global businesses. The goal of this project is to have a similar, yet distinct, revelation about US economic policy that will improve on the insights found in this study. It is similar in the point that it wants to show the interconnectedness of the Federal Reserve and different private jobs, companies and industries. However, it is different in the way it plans to achieve this goal. The illustration and network map used for this project will not look like this one, as it is not the best way to visualize the data this project will collect. This project will use multiple network maps to visualize different descriptive characteristics about Federal Reserve board members. Multiple network maps will be used so that it is easier for the audience to digest the same nodes in the map while only changing the edges (relationships) of the data.


## History of the Project

There has been limited preliminary research and planning already completed for this project. The project director has come to a conclusion as to how large the data set will be, the entire population of governor board members, as well as how the data will be collected, cleansed, analyzed and visualized.

The project director has previously completed related work including a project analyzing the interconnectedness of various tax related Supreme Court decisions using the same network map currently planned to use in this project. There has been no previous financial support for this project nor has there been any previous publications from this project director.

Once the data collection program is perfected, it will be quite simple to indefinitely continue this project. New governor board members are only appointed every two years or so, so at those time intervals the studies population can be increased. As of this writing, there have only ever been 94 members on the Board of Governors in the Fed’s history. Over time, an increasing population will improve the data set so that we can rely on the findings of this project to a greater extent.

As a student at the University of Richmond, the project director will be able to utilize additional resources from the Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) at the university during the completion of the project. There are many field experts who are available for reference to this project that will help with any problems that arise during the execution phase of the project. Once the main body of the project is finished, the DSL will provide ongoing support by updating the dataset when a new board member is appointed.


## Work Plan

The work plan outlines the specific tasks that are to be completed to achieve a successful result.

### Research

Prior to the data collection phase of the project, there will need to be a phase of research compromising of a few different goals. There will need to be comprehensive research to gain a better understanding of how the Federal Reserve Bank operates and how it interacts with the Board of Governors. Additionally, the project team will need to decide on what data is to be collected based on preceding research. As it currently stands, the project will collect data of various descriptive characteristics and some quantitative characteristics of each board member, past and present.

The different characteristics in this project will include but will not be limited to:
*	Race
*	Gender
*	Religion
*	Age
*	State of origin
*	Prior employer
*	Prior industry
*	Prior job title
*	Year of appointment
*	Political affiliation
*	Appointing President
*	Senate confirmation vote

### Data collection and cleansing

A new program will be created to amass the data and cleanse it into the right format. The program will scan a plethora of different sources to compile all the necessary data. Some of the sources of data include publications such as: federalreserve.gov, the Wall Street Journal, CNBC and LinkedIn. A considerable amount of the data will come directly from the Federal Reserve’s website. However, some data such as the senate confirmation vote, will have to come from other news sources. Once the program collects the correct data, another program will format the data so that it is acceptable and can be processed by the network building program.

### Network building

The networks will be built using Rstudio. The program language is already created, as it has already been used in a previous project analyzing Supreme Court cases discussed later. It may be necessary to make some adjustments to the coding language.

The network would be comprised of dozens of nodes linked together by edges based on a similar relationship. In this project, each node will be a previous or existing board member. Each node in the network can be connected to another node based on their relationship. These connections are called edges, which are often used to describe only one variety of relationship (Weingart, Journal of DH, 2011). For example, if two individuals were both republican, their nodes would be connected by one edge.

The nodes in this project would depict an individual board member. Since there has only ever been 94 board members, there would be 94 nodes in each network map, assuming the project would successfully gather sufficient and complete dataset. Nodes would be color coordinated based on a common trait within each characteristic. For example, for the state of origin network map, members from the Midwest would be colored green, with members from the Northeast would be colored red, etc. Below is an example from the Supreme Court project of what a network map could potentially look like.

There are some risks associated with completing this project. There exists a risk of false data as well as a risk of coding error. This project will rely on a program to research and compile the raw data for analysis.

The chance of encountering a coding error is considered to be minimal. While there is a chance the newly written program to acquire data may contain errors, the code used to create the network maps does not contain errors. It does not contain any errors because it has been used successfully in the past. If the network maps do not appear as they should, it will be obvious there is a problem with the data collection code because it did not compile the raw data correctly.

### Evaluation plans

There is an evaluation plan in place. The majority of the work for this project will be completed by the project’s director, Matt Fichera, who will regularly seek conference with the project’s co-director Dr. Lauren Tilton for advice and to reaffirm the project’s goal.


## Final Product and Dissemination

The nodes that are considered to be most central to each of the network maps will be considered most important. Centrality is generally used to determine how important nodes are in a network. As previously discussed, each individual board member will be represented by their own node, meaning the nodes considered central to each network will be the best indicators of economic policy in the US. In social networks, such as the one in this project, centrality can be the amount of influence or power someone has (Weingart, Journal of DH, 2011). This process will be repeated for each network that can apply to the collected data.

The nodes that would be considered to be most central to the overall network are the ones with the most edges, also known as degrees. Every time two nodes share the same descriptive characteristic, they will be considered to have a relationship, which will be depicted by a line, called an edge, connecting the two nodes. For example, if the political affiliation of Republican has more edges than Democrat, then it can be concluded that there is a stronger conservative influence on US economic policy.

The completed project will be distributed through a myriad of media sources. The findings will be submitted for publication in various academic journals, such as the Journal of Finance and the Journal of Digital Humanities. The project director has decided the Journal of Finance to be more appropriate than the Journal of Economics because the Journal of Finance has a much larger audience base and is considered more prestigious. If the findings are denied publication, they will be made publicly available and distributed via the internet across a multitude of platforms.

If funded, the project will be inclusive of disabilities by including an audio version of the final results.

The project will require the development of some new software. Any code or other evidence gathering programs that will be developed will eventually become open-source and be transparent in its findings. The project director will also encourage the use of the software to be used by anyone in future related projects.
