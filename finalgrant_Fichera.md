The work plan outlines the specific tasks that are to be completed to achieve a successful result.

### Research

Prior to the data collection phase of the project, there will need to be a phase of research compromising of a few different goals. There will need to be comprehensive research to gain a better understanding of how the Federal Reserve Bank operates and how it interacts with the Board of Governors. Additionally, the project team will need to decide on what data is to be collected based on preceding research. As it currently stands, the project will collect data of various descriptive characteristics and some quantitative characteristics of each board member, past and present.

The different characteristics in this project will include but will not be limited to:
*	Race
*	Gender
*	Religion
*	Age
*	State of origin
*	Prior employer
*	Prior industry
*	Prior job title
*	Year of appointment
*	Political affiliation
*	Appointing President
*	Senate confirmation vote

### Data collection and cleansing

A new program will be created to amass the data and cleanse it into the right format. The program will scan a plethora of different sources to compile all the necessary data. Some of the sources of data include publications such as: federalreserve.gov, the Wall Street Journal, CNBC and LinkedIn. A considerable amount of the data will come directly from the Federal Reserve’s website. However, some data such as the senate confirmation vote, will have to come from other news sources. Once the program collects the correct data, another program will format the data so that it is acceptable and can be processed by the network building program.

### Network building

The networks will be built using Rstudio. The program language is already created, as it has already been used in a previous project analyzing Supreme Court cases discussed later. It may be necessary to make some adjustments to the coding language.

The network would be comprised of dozens of nodes linked together by edges based on a similar relationship. In this project, each node will be a previous or existing board member. Each node in the network can be connected to another node based on their relationship. These connections are called edges, which are often used to describe only one variety of relationship (Weingart, Journal of DH, 2011). For example, if two individuals were both republican, their nodes would be connected by one edge.

The nodes in this project would depict an individual board member. Since there has only ever been 94 board members, there would be 94 nodes in each network map, assuming the project would successfully gather sufficient and complete dataset. Nodes would be color coordinated based on a common trait within each characteristic. For example, for the state of origin network map, members from the Midwest would be colored green, with members from the Northeast would be colored red, etc. Below is an example from the Supreme Court project of what a network map could potentially look like.

There are some risks associated with completing this project. There exists a risk of false data as well as a risk of coding error. This project will rely on a program to research and compile the raw data for analysis.

The chance of encountering a coding error is considered to be minimal. While there is a chance the newly written program to acquire data may contain errors, the code used to create the network maps does not contain errors. It does not contain any errors because it has been used successfully in the past. If the network maps do not appear as they should, it will be obvious there is a problem with the data collection code because it did not compile the raw data correctly.

### Evaluation plans

There is an evaluation plan in place. The majority of the work for this project will be completed by the project’s director, Matt Fichera, who will regularly seek conference with the project’s co-director Dr. Lauren Tilton for advice and to reaffirm the project’s goal.


## Final Product and Dissemination

## Biographies

Matt Fichera is a 21-year old undergraduate student at the University of Richmond. In May he will receive a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree with a major in accounting and a concentration in finance. Upon graduation, Matt will spend the summer studying and preparing for the CPA exam (Certified Public Accountant), a certificate strongly recommended to obtain in the industry he will be working in. In September, Matt will begin working at PwC, a public accounting firm, in Washington DC. He will be working in the firm’s audit practice, on clients such as Mars, Inc. and Centrus.

This semester, Matt completed an undergraduate course titled Introduction to Digital Humanities. In the class, he mastered digital humanities topics such as text analysis, network modeling and spatial analysis. In class, he read multiple academic articles relating to each topic of study as well as completed in-class labs and extended written assignments. Due to his expertise in network modeling form his course, Matt will understand how to collect the data described in this brief, and how to prepare it for analysis through a program using Rstudio.

Outside of his studies, Matt likes to spend his spare time with friends and family, eat good food, go to festivals, and travel around the world.
